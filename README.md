## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

The most challenging part of this lab was getting everything set up in Github as I had some issues with permissions. Despite this, I learned a lot about how to format things and correctly use sematic HTML. This was really interesting to me because, although I have some previous with HTML, it was mostly self-taught and so my current knowledge is not as technical or accesibility focused. This is something I have wanted to change so this lab was very helpful. In the future I want to add more formatting and more extensive information about myself so the portfolio is more professional and put together.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
